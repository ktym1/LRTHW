# write(string) â†’ integer
# Writes the given string to ios. The stream must be opened for writing. 
# If the argument is not a string, it will be converted to a string using to_s. Returns the number of bytes written.
# 
# count = $stdout.write("This is a test\n")
# puts "That was #{count} bytes of data"
# produces:
# 
# This is a test
# That was 15 bytes of data

# open with 'w' mode
# "w": Write-only, truncates existing file to zero length or creates a new file for writing.
# => no need to call .truncate()
